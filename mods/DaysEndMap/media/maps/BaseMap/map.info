title=Muldraugh, KY
lots=BaseMap
description=Muldraugh is a small town in an area the locals know as "Knox Country" - the dead centre of the State of Kentucky. It grew as an Army town, but now welcomes folks from all walks of life - some commuters to the bigger towns nearby, some military families and some living below the poverty line. <LINE> <LINE> It's a small place, filled with good people - not to mention Spiffo’s finest Chicken and Biscuits this side of Kentucky! Sure, not much happens here - but that doesn't mean Muldraugh life is dull...
